## ⏭️ What's Next
- MIDI Format (we are giving an attempt):
        - Make a "band option" in the room so instead of displaying a picture of
        the chord sheet, it will display respective notes for the host to play live line by line
        - Will involve scraping MIDI formatted songs alongside our current ChordPro
        database
        - Need to do research into the computations to align songs based on bpm, tempo, etc-


## 🛑 Blockers or Questions
