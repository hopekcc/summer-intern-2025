## ‚úÖ What's Done
- Worked on the planning guide for the server team, to plan our timeline moving forward.
- Created a firebase project/console and tied it into the server
- Made a file to create a test token to see if it is passing correctly (it is).
- Waiting to review PRs once they are up.


---

## üîÑ What's Active (with ETA)
- Implment the Server to run on the VM (1 Week)
- Try to get chordpro conversion working locally (ETA: 1-2 weeks)
- Figure the schema with the Web Team (1 Week)


---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next
- Make sure web team and mobile team are integrated with firebase approriately
- Batch conversion -- ChordPro conversion
- Logs / Error activation

---

## üõë Blockers or Questions
- Not understanding the schema in relation to web/mobile team. Hard to truly make the server without a set idea for how the schema will look on their side. 
- Gaining clarity on how the schema will look would help a lot, as we can then make the routes and make sure tokens are being passed properly from the website to the server (should be fine either way since we tested this, but can never be too careful).
