## ‚úÖ What's Done
- The team has a new document with all our specific API endpoints that we need to design. (2hr)
     - Sharing this with web, they are free to add any of their own requests or just reference the doc as needed
- Made progress on a couple of these, including: (16hr)
    - Listing all songs
    - SongsID
    - Conversion to PDF
    - Song Searching

---

## üîÑ What's Active (with ETA)
- Continuing to work on more endpoints and making sure all calls are functioning (~1-2 weeks)
- Batch Conversion

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next
- Make sure that web/android team are able to connect well with this and the calls work from their end 
(99% sure it should work since we test it ourselves with a token, but better to be safe)
- Implement other endpoints that the other teams would like to see

## üõë Blockers or Questions

- Blocker: Need to start setting up personal computer with all the right server tools. 
Currently working as a group through meetings, and figured it would be more efficient if we worked outside of the server meetings too. Ended up having some trouble setting up env file and other requirements, so that is something that will likely be fixed soon (1 day?).
Not a major blocker as we are still getting work done more than efficiently, but it is also a good way for me to dive deeper and investigate ways in off time to make the code even better :). 

- Question: How do we want to go about setting up the web/android team with our code and assist them in making sure they understand our code and how they want to tie it in to their frontend? Feel as though there might be a communication gap here that could be filled.
Potential Solution: Setup a mid week meeting with the team?
