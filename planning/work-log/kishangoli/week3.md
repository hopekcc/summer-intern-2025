## üõë Blockers or Questions

- Blocker: Need to figure out the firebase situation. We are currently using a console that was created on my personal account, but for long term purposes, we will need to
move this over to a HopeKCC account if possible. We are still working on this console and are hoping we can just transfer ownership at the best case to a HopeKCC account.
Worst case we will have to do some manual transfering.

- Blocker: Github secrets. We currently have the server running live, but we need github secrets to hold our env code to actually test with this. Right now all our authentication fails because its not linked to our database users.

- Blocker: Access to each others VMs.

- Questions: No questions at the moment, seeing a lot of great progress as of now! :)
