## ✅ What's Done
- While waiting the real database being made up, made a fake database by myself to implement part of the ideas
- Making the "search_artist" and "search_title" more connected to database method instead of hardcoded everything inside python app.py
- Add the "search" from the navbar which can let the user search in two ways: search by artist and search by titles.
- Help teammate deploying the PDF display page so the pdf version can be shown  on the website

## ⏭ What's Next

- More communication and coordination are needed when working on server/database integration.
