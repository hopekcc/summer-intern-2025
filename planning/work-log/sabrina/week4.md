## 🛑 Blockers or Questions

- It’s difficult to determine which features to add or develop further without communication from the server team so we’re planning a meeting with them to clarify responsibilities, particularly around host and client roles
 - We also need to coordinate with the website team to ensure cohesive UI themes and features across platforms
