## 🛑 Blockers or Questions
- **Blockers: I'm concerned I may not be able to complete up to Unit 6 by Tuesday as recommended.
      - While I am working faster than each unit’s estimated 10–28+ hours, 
         I still don’t think Tuesday is a realistic timeline for me, however, 
         I will continue to work as quickly and thoroughly as I can!
         
- **Questions: How should the pull request review process look? 
  For example, what exactly should we be checking for, 
  and is there a specific way we should format 
  or leave our feedback?
