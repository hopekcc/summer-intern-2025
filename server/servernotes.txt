Server Team Notes:
When running the app locally we can test the application with the command:
uvicorn main:app --reload which will run the main.py file, and also reload
to match any changes we make to the file while the server is running.

When runnning on the cloud we use:
uvicorn server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
With host being the key difference as it keeps it active to the whole internet
not just locally.
