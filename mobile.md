## Reflection
### What Could Have Been Done Better
- Ensure all team members attended our presentation practice meeting, especially those who had completed slides, so we could focus on practicing transitions and timing.  
- Allocate more time to practice each team memberâ€™s part to ensure the presentation fits within the allotted time.  
- Improve coordination so everyone knows what others are presenting and have demos recorded ahead of time, resulting in a more cohesive presentation.
